## ðŸ“ˆ Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting.

2. **EDA**
   - Visualized distributions, correlations, and patterns.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Encoded categorical variables
   - Scaled numeric data

4. **Modeling**
   - Applied multiple algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
   - Compared metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score

5. **Evaluation**
   - Used confusion matrices and classification reports
   - Visualized model performance
